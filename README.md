# CO2-Emission-Global-Trend-Analysis

📊 CO2 Emissions Analysis and Prediction Project
🚀 Project Overview
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of CO2 emissions by country, focusing on identifying key trends, correlations, and actionable insights. Additionally, a predictive model is built to forecast future CO2 emissions, aiding in strategic environmental decision-making.

🌱 Objectives:
Analyze historical CO2 emissions data to identify key patterns and trends.
Correlate total emissions with per capita emissions to understand country-specific impacts.
Predict future CO2 emissions using a machine learning model.
Provide recommendations for policy changes and sustainable development strategies.

📈 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains CO2 emissions data by country over multiple years. It includes:

Country: Name of the country.
Year: Year of recorded data.
Kilotons of CO2: Total CO2 emissions in kilotons.
Metric Tons Per Capita: Average CO2 emissions per capita.
Data Source:
The dataset was obtained from publicly available environmental databases and preprocessed to ensure quality and consistency.

🛠️ Installation
To run this project, you need Python 3.8+ and the following dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Key Libraries:
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning model building.
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase involved:

Analyzing global CO2 emission trends from 1960 to 2020.
Identifying top contributing countries and their emission patterns.
Correlation analysis between total CO2 emissions and emissions per capita.
Key Insights:
Significant rise in global CO2 emissions over the past 60 years.
The top 5 countries contribute to over 60% of global emissions.
Strong positive correlation between total emissions and per capita emissions, highlighting countries with both high total and high individual emissions.

📊 Visualizations
The project includes several visualizations to illustrate key findings:

Global Emissions Trend: A line chart showing the trend over time.
Top Emitting Countries: Bar chart highlighting the largest contributors.
Correlation Plot: Scatter plot showing the relationship between total emissions and emissions per capita.
Predicted Emissions: A line chart comparing actual vs. predicted values.

📝 Recommendations
Based on the analysis and predictions, here are some suggested actions:

Focus on Major Emitters: Prioritize emission reduction strategies in top-emitting countries.
Promote Renewable Energy: Shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources like wind and solar.
Strengthen International Agreements: Advocate for stronger commitments in climate accords like the Paris Agreement.
Invest in Green Technologies: Encourage the adoption of energy-efficient technologies and carbon capture solutions.
📅 Future Work
Include additional variables like GDP, population growth, and energy consumption for a more comprehensive analysis.
Experiment with other machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, Neural Networks) to improve prediction accuracy.
Integrate real-time CO2 monitoring data for continuous analysis and forecasting.
